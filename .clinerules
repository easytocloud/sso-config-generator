# SSO Config Generator - Development Guidelines

## Project Overview
- Python CLI tool for generating AWS SSO configuration and directory structures
- Simplifies AWS SSO configuration management by generating config files and directory structures
- Designed to work with direnv for automatic profile switching

## Key Components
- `core.py`: Main implementation of SSOConfigGenerator class
- `cli.py`: Command-line interface using Click
- `version.py`: Single source of truth for version information

## Design Patterns
- Class-based implementation with clear separation of concerns
- Configuration caching for performance optimization
- Hierarchical directory structure mirroring AWS Organizations

## Configuration Handling
- AWS config file is modified with a managed block between markers:
  ```
  # BEGIN SSO-CONFIG-GENERATOR MANAGED BLOCK
  # END SSO-CONFIG-GENERATOR MANAGED BLOCK
  ```
- All environments must include the reusable SSO browser profile below inside `~/.aws/config` (adjust region only if needed):
  ```
  [profile sso-browser]
  sso_session = sso
  region = eu-west-1
  output = json
  ```
- OU structure is cached in `.ou` file in the same directory as AWS config
- Generator config is stored in `.generate-sso-config` in the base directory

## AWS SSO Integration
- Uses boto3 for AWS API interactions
- Supports both legacy and newer sso-session configuration formats
- Extracts SSO name from SSO start URL for directory naming

## Environment Detection
- Automatically detects Cloud9/CloudX environments
- If current directory is named "environment", SSO name is automatically skipped
- Supports unified root directory for all account directories

## Versioning
- Uses semantic versioning
- Version is stored in `version.py` and imported by `__init__.py`
- Automated versioning via GitHub workflow and semantic-release

## Command Conventions
- Use `uvx sso-config-generator` to run the tool (uv package manager)
- All boolean flags have both positive and negative forms (e.g., `--use-ou-structure/--no-use-ou-structure`)

## Common Issues
- "Error: You must specify a region" - Set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION or configure in ~/.aws/config
- "Unable to locate credentials" - Run `aws sso login` to refresh SSO credentials
- "SSO session is expired" - Run `aws sso login` to start a new session

## Development Workflow
- Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`
- Build package: `pip install build && python -m build`
- Test changes: `./test_sso_config.sh`
- Commit messages follow conventional commits for automated versioning:
  - `feat:` - Minor version increment
  - `fix:`, `docs:`, etc. - Patch version increment
